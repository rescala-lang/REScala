This is an https://www.scala-sbt.org/[sbt] project, the sbt launcher script is included,
so all commands should work with only a local JVM installed. Tested on openjdk-11.
`./sbt` launches an interactive compile shell, which makes incremental compilation much faster,
for batch processing, use `./sbt some commands`

Examples:

....
# compile the project
./sbt compile

# run the server
./sbt server/run

# commandline parameters
./sbt "server/run ar1 arg2"
....


== Deployment

....
# deploy to jars + scripts
./sbt stage
....

This produces a folder containing a standalone version of the server in

....
./server/target/universal/stage
....

which can then be executed the same as the `run` command above:

....
cd ./server/target/universal/stage
bin/
....
