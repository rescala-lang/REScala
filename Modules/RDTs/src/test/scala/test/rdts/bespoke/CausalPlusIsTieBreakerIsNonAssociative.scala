     * Specifically, if we accept the causal order as truth (if defined), then we must ensure that the tiebreaker of a larger value also dominates all tiebreakers of values that are smaller than any causally smaller values.
     * For example, the `a` above is causally ordered after the `c` but its tiebreaker is smaller that the tiebreaker of `b`.
     * As far as I can tell, the only way to fix this, is to have the tiebreaker of `a` be larger than the tiebreaker of any causally smaller values. Buf if we can achieve that, we don’t need the explicit causal order anymore, and can rely solely on the tiebreaker.
