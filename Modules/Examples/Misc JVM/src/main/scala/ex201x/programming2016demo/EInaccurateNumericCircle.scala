/** So far, we demonstrated the Signal abstraction, which allows modular,
  * yet declarative implementation of interactive applications through
  * deriving state with constraints. The persistent values of Signals
  * are complemented by briefly occurring, transient values of Events,
  * the second fundamental abstraction of RP for event-based programming.
  *
  * To introduce Events, we refactor our animation into a numeric
  * simulation. So far, we described the moving circle's trajectory
  * through arithmetic formulae. In the final application, though, the
  * ball should bounce off walls and rackets, making it much more
  * cumbersome to describe its trajectory arithmetically. Therefore, we
  * migrate its trajectory to be simulated through numeric integration,
  * using the euler method as the simplest approach. This means, the
  * application has to be driven in discrete time increments, which we
  * can easily model as Evt ticks. Equally to Vars being a manually
  * assignable type of Signals, Evts are Events which can be manually
  * triggered. Thus, we can add an according trigger in our main method.
  *
  * Events and Signals in RP are tightly integrated. We already showed,
  * how new Signals can be derived from existing ones, and new Events
  * can be derived equally. We will show Event expressions and several
  * Event combinators later. In addition, though, Signals and Events
  * can also be derived from each other. To implement our numeric
  * integration, we do in fact need such a transformation. First,
  * we use the previous definition of posX and posY now to define
  * the moving circle's velocityX and velocityY, adding a "per
  * nanosecond" factor to each. We then redefine Signals posX and
  * posY as the result of folding over the Event ticks. Just like
  * fold can compute an aggregate over all elements of a List, it
  * here computes an aggregate Signal over all Event values that
  * occurred so far, updated whenever the event emits a value.
  *
  * The euler method defines x for the next step as x of the previous
  * step plus the product of the velocity of the previous step times
  * the length of the step. X of the previous step and the length of
  * the step are given as parameters to the fold closure. To access
  * the velocity of the previous step, Signals offer the before method.
  * Usually, this method is necessary to break data dependency cycles.
  * For instance, for the Pong game, the ball's velocity is dependent
  * on the ball colliding with the field boundary and player rackets.
  * The balls collisions are dependent on the balls position. If the
  * balls position now would depend on the velocity, these dependencies
  * would form an endless loop. But, by using velocity.before, this
  * loop is broken, and the program is well-defined.
