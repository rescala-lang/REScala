/** We now add a playing field to our game. We begin implementing this
  * as a separate module from the beginning. It implements a rectangle
  * that resizes to match the ShapesPanel's size. We add a method to
  * this class, that given a shape (e.g., the ball) returns a set of
  * four collision events, one for each side of the rectangle.
  *
  * To compute these collision events, we first define for each side
  * of the PlayingField a Signal that reflects, whether or not the
  * ball is in bounds w.r.t. this side. We then derive a changed
  * Event, which emits each new value of the signal. Finally, we
  * derive another filtered event, that only forwards the emitted
  * value if it is true, i.e., emits only if the ball moved out
  * of bounds, but does not emit if it moved back in bounds.
  * Alternatively, we can shortcut these two derivations by using
  * changedTo(true), which yields the same result.
  *
  * With all collision events defined, we can now instantiate them
  * for our BouncingBall. Then, we replace the left and right mouse
  * buttons for horizontal and vertical bounces by the respective
  * collision events.
