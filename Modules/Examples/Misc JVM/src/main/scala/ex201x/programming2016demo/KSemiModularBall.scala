/** We now convert our BouncingBall into an external Module, similar
  * to Clock earlier. We begin by wrapping the movement code into
  * a class. We leave the ball diameter and position reset Event as
  * a Signal and Event that are passed in at instantiation. We make
  * the circle shape a member of the class, to serve as it's output.
  * Finally, to decouple the BouncingBall class entirely from the
  * ShapesPanel, we need to make the horizontal and vertical bounce
  * events a parameter defined from outside as well. But, here we
  * will run into another cyclic dependency issue. Eventually, the
  * ball should bounce when its position collides with the playing
  * field borders, meaning the bounce events that the BouncingBall
  * class requires for instantiation can only be defined based on
  * its output, i.e., after the ball has already been instantiated.
  * This is not a cyclic dependency issue in the sense that it
  * creates an infinite loop in the application, because posX and
  * posY are already defined on velocityX.before and velocityY.before
  * respectively, but it still is a cyclic problem in terms of the
  * instantiation order of the involved Signals and Events.
