/** As with the initial arithmetic trajectory, the numeric integration so far
  * is vulnerable to clock drift. To fix this, we derive integration ticks from
  * the accurately system clock-based nsTime Signal, using a conversion in the
  * other direction, from Signals to Events. Signal provide a change method,
  * which derives an event stream that emits a tuple of values (old, new)
  * whenever the signal is updated. From this, we derive another event stream
  * that transforms each of these tuples into a number by subtracting the old
  * value from the new. This essentially implements numeric differentiation,
  * emitting the time elapsed between each nsTime update. Accordingly, the
  * manual triggering of ticks in the main thread is no longer necessary.
