/** To resolve this circular initialization order, we introduce
  * higher-order reactives. Higher-order reactives are Signals
  * or Events, whose values contain references to other Signals
  * or Events. We have already been using a higher-order
  * reactive for a while, namely since we made the circle's
  * trajectory scale with the ShapesPanel's size. We started
  * using shapes in its initialization, defined as a
  * Var[List[Shape]], and each Shape contains several Signals
  * defining its position, size, etc. Thus, shapes already is a
  * higher-order reactive.
  *
  * To implement our horizontal and vertical bounces, we now use
  * a similar pattern, although their higher-order-ness is much
  * clearer. For both, we define a Var[List[Event[Any]]], which
  * we initialize with an empty List. This signature clearly
  * shows, that the outer Var contains pointers to several inner
  * Events. To be able to use these higher-order reactives in
  * place of the leftButton.pressed and rightButton.pressed, we
  * need to flatten these higher-order reactives into regular
  * Events. The according flatten method is available on any
  * reactive, whose values reference other reactives either
  * directly or indirected through any collection of the scala
  * standard library. The type of reactive returned is a normal
  * reactive (or, one layer less higher-order), with the concrete
  * type depending on the type signature of the higher-order
  * reactive that is being flattened. E.g., a Signal[Signal[T]]
  * will simply become a Signal[T]. A Signal[Event[T]] will
  * become an Event[T]. A Signal[Set[Signal[T]] will become a
  * Signal[Set[T]]. A Signal[List[Event[T]]], as we use it here,
  * is the most complex case, becoming an Event[List[Option[T]]].
  * The Option wrapper models, that not just one, but each Event
  * in the Signal may or may not have emitted a value
  * simultaneously. Higher-order reactives containing only a
  * single Event rather than a multiples do not have this option
  * wrapper because it is redundant -- if the one inner Event
  * did not emit a value, then the flattened result will also
  * not emit a value, i.e., the None case never occurs.
  *
  * Having implemented both higher-order bounce Vars and having
  * changed both velocities to depend on their flattened
  * counterparts, the BouncingBall class is now independent of
  * the ShapesPanel. To complete the refactoring, all that is
  * left to do is add the left and right mouse button to the
  * respective list of bounce sources, equally to how the ball
  * shape is added to the list of displayed shapes for the
  * ShapesPanel.
