## Implementation

## Running

You need sbt beforehand. Last tested using sbt 1.9.9.

Run with:

~~~
cd "REScala main repository"
$ sbt "project todolist" deploy           # get scala dependencies and compile scala to js
cd "todolist subfolder (this file)"
$ firefox target/index.html               # open todomvc in browser
~~~
