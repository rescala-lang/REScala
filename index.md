Rescala delivers functional reactive programming on the JVM and the web.
Providing asynchronous collections of events with a rich API of stream transformations,
with managed consistent up-to-date state, and minimal syntactic overhead.
All integrated seamlessly into modern, object-oriented and functional, concurrent, distributed programs.

## Functional
{: class="info-box"}
With abstractions for Events and Signals to handle interactions and state, and seamless conversions between them.

## Consistent
{: class="info-box"}
No temporary inconsistencies, no data races, define logical constraints and derivations, and they will always be satisfied.

## Concurrent
{: class="info-box"}
Use reactive abstractions from any thread in any order, add reactives, remove them, change their connections, and it still just works.

Software applications must react to external changes such as the input from the user and network messages.
Traditionally, object-oriented software adopts the Observer pattern to implement reactivity and decouple the observers from the observables.
Whereas researchers have highlighted the drawbacks of this style for a long time, alternatives struggle to be widely accepted.
In particular, functional reactive programming and dataflow programming – which aim to represent time-changing values as first class abstractions – are promising,
but hardly escape the functional setting. On the other hand, event-based languages directly support events but do not achieve the declarative style of more functional approaches.


Rescala is a reactive language which integrates concepts from event-based and functional-reactive programming into the object-oriented world.
Rescala supports the development of reactive applications by fostering a functional and declarative style which complements the advantages of object-oriented design.
